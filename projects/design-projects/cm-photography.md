# CM Photography

CM Photography is a professional photography and photo editing company, founded by Paola, an innovative entrepreneur from Venezuela. The company specializes in capturing photos and providing expert photo editing and retouching services. They worked with numerous companies such as TripWix, a luxury real estate company, and Social Way, a video marketing agency.  During my period working with them I designed multiple creatives but the one that really stood out in terms of importance was the portfolio.

## Team

Paola, the founder of CM Photography, is an entrepreneur with a deep-rooted passion for creativity and visual storytelling. Her expertise in both photography and photo editing allows her to guide her team in producing top-tier work, from concept to final product. On her request, I have created her company's portfolio as well as her personal one. 

## Portfolio
The portfolio I designed for CM Photography highlights their work with clients, it features a curated selection of striking images and Lightroom presets that showcase Paola's expertise in photography and editing, effectively capturing their unique visual storytelling.
