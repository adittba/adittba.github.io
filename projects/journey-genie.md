## Market Analysis

<p class="market-analysis-description"><strong>Market Analysis</strong> is essential before building a new app to understand user needs, identify competitors, and assess demand. During this step, we gathered data from reliable sources to support my decision to move forward with building this new product. </p>

### Key Findings


<!--first market analysis key finding -->
<p class="key-findings-description">1. During our market analysis period we had numerous interesting key findings, one of them being that adventure tourism is one of the fastest-growing segments in the travel industry. Valued at approximately $282 billion in 2021, the adventure tourism market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.2% from 2022 to 2030, potentially reaching $1,169 billion by 2030. This forecast is also represented in the chart below.</p>

<style>
  .source {
    font-style: italic; /* Makes the text italic */
    font-size: 14px; /* Adjusts the size to be smaller */
    text-align: center; /* Centers the text horizontally */
    display: block; /* Ensures it's treated as a block element for proper centering */
    margin: 8px auto; /* Centers the block element on the page with some margin */
    margin-bottom: 40px !important
  }
</style>

<!--second market analysis key finding -->

<p class="key-findings-description">2. The second key finding is the growth of AI integration in travel. It has seen massive growth due to its potential for hyper-personalization, efficiency, and enhanced user experience. The global AI market in the travel and tourism sector was valued at $730 million in 2020, with a CAGR of 14.7% projected through 2026. AI in the travel ecosystem is mainly focused on chatbots and virtual assistants(it's projected that 85% of customer service interactions will be managed by AI by 2025.), predictive analisys and automation. </p>

<div class="source"> (Source: Mordor Intelligence, 2021) </div>

<!--third market analysis key finding -->

<p class="key-findings-description">3. The last third of the information we analyzed focused less on the adoption of AI and more on the extreme sports and activities market. According to the Adventure Tourism Report (2022), the following key insights were extracted: 65% of millennials indicate adventure travel as their preferred vacation style, female participation in adventure and extreme sports is currently estimated at 30% globally, and the skydiving industry alone is projected to reach a value of $5.1 billion by 2027 (up from $3.2 billion in 2022). This shows a clear trend towards thrill-seeking activities. The following pie chart was the primary source for a deep understanding of the target audience.

## Brand Guidelines

<p class="brand-description">A <strong> Brand Book</strong> (also known as Brand Guidelines) is a comprehensive document that defines the visual and communicative identity of a brand. For Journey Genie we chose to use bright modern colors and a minimal, industrial design. </p>

## Primary Sitemap

<p class="primary-sitemap-description">The<strong>Primary Sitemap</strong> is essential before building a new app to understand user needs, identify competitors, and assess demand. During this step, we designed a sitemap that is meeting all of our needs. It helps visualize user navigation, ensuring a smooth and intuitive experience for adventurers as they explore features like AI planning, social networking, and real-time updates. </p>

    border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
    border-radius: 20px; /* Adds rounded corners */
    overflow: hidden; /* Ensures content does not overflow the rounded corners */
  }

  /* Adjust height for tablets and larger mobile devices */
  @media (max-width: 768px) {

A strong emphasis has been placed on user-friendly navigation, ensuring that both adventurers and newcomers can easily find what they need. </p>
