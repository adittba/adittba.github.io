## CRM Management
I created and organized a comprehensive CRM system from scratch using GoHighLevel. This system allowed TGV to efficiently manage her growing follower base by keeping track of new followers and their interactions. I set up features that enabled easy communication and follow-up with clients, ensuring that no leads were overlooked.

## Email Marketing
I took charge of managing emails from TGV’s new followers, ensuring timely and effective communication. I developed targeted email campaigns to keep her audience engaged and informed about her content, recipes, and tips. By crafting personalized messages and newsletters, I aimed to create a sense of community among her followers. This proactive approach not only kept her audience interested but also encouraged them to engage further with her brand.

.small-image-container {
    display: flex;

    align-items: center;
    padding: 10px;                   /* Padding relative to the container size */
    margin-top: 10px !important;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    border-radius: 30px;
    box-shadow: 0 0 5px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);
    width: fit-content;                    /* Container width adjusts with the viewport */
    max-width: 500px;              /* Max width to prevent it from getting too large */
    margin: auto;
    background-color: #f1f1f100;        /* Ensures container maintains the same aspect ratio */
}

/* Styling for the image itself */
.small-styled-image {
    width: 100%;                   /* Image scales with container */
    height: auto;                  /* Maintain aspect ratio */
    border-radius: 20px;           /* Rounded corners for the image */
    box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); /* Soft drop shadow for the image */
}
</style>

## Email Newsletter Campaigns
 I collaborated with TGV's team to develop two email campaigns: a 14-day and a 30-day campaign focused on diet advice. These campaigns were strategically designed to provide valuable information to potential clients, establish TGV's expertise in nutrition, and encourage engagement. By crafting well-structured emails that offered actionable advice, we aimed to build trust and attract new clients to her services.


## Funnel Development
 I developed a client funnel that included personalized quizzes tailored to the needs of potential clients. This funnel was designed to guide users through a journey that not only provided valuable insights into their dietary needs but also positioned TGV as a knowledgeable resource. The quizzes engaged users and collected important information that helped tailor follow-up communications and services to individual preferences.

## Call Team Management
  I managed and instructed the call team responsible for booking appointments for TGV. I provided training and guidelines to ensure they effectively communicated with potential clients and supported TGV's existing clients. 

## Automations

I set up automations to make things easier for TGV’s team. When a new lead came in, the system sent automatic notifications to the team and updated the pipeline based on how responsive the lead was. I also automated sending rewards to followers right after they completed a survey, so the whole process ran smoothly without manual work.
