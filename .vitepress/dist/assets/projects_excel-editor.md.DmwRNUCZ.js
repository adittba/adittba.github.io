This Excel editor allows users to upload files, delete columns or rows as needed, save the formatting as presets, and apply those presets to multiple files with the same format. By automating this, marketing teams can create different file formats for various purposes, like cold calling or email marketing, saving time and reducing manual errors.</p></div><h2 id="use-case" tabindex="-1" data-v-07b3e22c>Use Case <a class="header-anchor" href="#use-case" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Use Case&quot;" data-v-07b3e22c>​</a></h2><div class="section" data-v-07b3e22c><p data-v-07b3e22c>Marketing companies often receive lead files that need to be formatted differently depending on the purpose.
