These campaigns were strategically designed to provide valuable information to potential clients, establish TGV&#39;s expertise in nutrition, and encourage engagement.

When a new lead came in, the system sent automatic notifications to the team and updated the pipeline based on how responsive the lead was. I also automated sending rewards to followers right after they completed a survey, so the whole process ran smoothly without manual work.</p><link rel="stylesheet" href="/.vitepress/theme/style-assets/image-style.css"><div class="image-container"><img src="'+c+'" class="styled-image" alt="Descriptive text"></div>',23)]))}const w=a(m,[["render",d]]);export{y as __pageData,w as default};
