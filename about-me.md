Hi! I'm **Adrian**, a 21-year-old. I've always been passionate about design, and my experiences in web design really sparked my interest in project management. I have a strong understanding of Agile and Scrum practices, key to driving efficient project completion.

I've been living on my own since I was 17, which has taught me a lot about being responsible and self-motivated. I'm finishing up my business administration studies and looking forward to starting my master's. I'm also working on getting my PMP certification this year to enhance my skills in project management.

I have knowledge about coding too â€” mainly Python â€” which helps me work well with different teams and understand both the technical and creative sides of a project. It also helps me create cool websites, like this one. 

:::tip TL;DRðŸ’¡
 Iâ€™m Adrian, 21. With a background in project management and web design, I'm preparing for my master's and PMP certification. Ready to bring my Agile expertise to exciting new projects.
